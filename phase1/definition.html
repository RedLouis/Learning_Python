    <h1>Definition of Programming</h1>
    <p>
        Programming, in the context of computer science and software development, refers to the process of designing, writing, and creating instructions (code) that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written using programming languages, which act as a bridge between human-readable code and machine-executable code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programming involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and designing algorithms and data structures to solve these tasks efficiently. Programmers use specific syntax and semantics of programming languages to communicate with computers and tell them how to perform tasks and make decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The end goal of programming is to develop software applications, scripts, or systems that can automate processes, perform calculations, manipulate data, and provide various functionalities to users. Programming is a fundamental skill in modern technology and is used in a wide range of fields, including software development, web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
    </p>
    <p>Simple definition: Programming is the process of creating instructions (code) for computers to perform specific tasks and operations.</p>
