    <h1>Python Installation Guide</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Download Python</h2>
    <p>Python is available for various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Download Python</a></p>

    <h2>Step 2: Run the Installer</h2>
    <p>Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file and run the Python installer. Follow the installation wizard's instructions to install Python on your computer.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Add Python to PATH (Windows Users)</h2>
    <p>If you are using Windows, you may need to add Python to the system PATH to run Python from the Command Prompt or PowerShell. During the installation process, make sure to check the box "Add Python x.x to PATH."</p>
    <p>If you missed this step during installation, you can still add Python to PATH manually. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu, click "Edit the system environment variables," and then click "Environment Variables." In the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable, click "Edit," and add the path to your Python installation (e.g., C:\PythonXX\;C:\PythonXX\Scripts\).</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Verify the Installation</h2>
    <p>To ensure Python is installed correctly, open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and type the following command:</p>
    <code>python --version</code>
    <p>If installed correctly, the version of Python you installed will be displayed.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Start Coding in Python!</h2>
    <p>Congratulations! You've successfully installed Python on your computer. Now you're ready to start coding in Python and embark on your programming journey.</p>

    <h1>Python Installation and IDE Setup</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Download Python</h2>
    <!-- ... (the previous steps for Python installation) ... -->

    <h2>Step 2: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
    <p>An IDE provides a complete set of tools for coding, debugging, and running Python programs. Two popular IDEs for Python are <strong>PyCharm</strong> and <strong>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong>. You can choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: PyCharm</h2>
    <p><strong>PyCharm</strong> is a powerful Python IDE developed by JetBrains. It offers features like intelligent code completion, code analysis, and version control integration.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Download PyCharm:</strong> You can download the Community edition (free) or the Professional edition (paid) from the official website: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" target="_blank">Download PyCharm</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Install PyCharm:</strong> Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions to set up PyCharm on your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a New Project:</strong> Open PyCharm, click "Create New Project," and choose a project location and interpreter (make sure to select the Python interpreter you installed earlier).</li>
        <li><strong>Start Coding:</strong> PyCharm's user-friendly interface allows you to start coding Python programs right away. Write your code in the editor, run it, and see the results in the console.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 4: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</h2>
    <p><strong>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong> is a lightweight, customizable code editor developed by Microsoft. It has a vast extension library that allows you to tailor the editor to your needs.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Download VSCode:</strong> You can download Visual Studio Code for free from the official website: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Download VSCode</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Install VSCode:</strong> Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions to set up VSCode on your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Python Extension:</strong> Open VSCode and install the Python extension by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for "Python," and clicking "Install" on the Python extension by Microsoft.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a New Python File:</strong> Click on the Explorer view (Ctrl+Shift+E) and right-click on the desired folder. Choose "New File" and name it with a .py extension, e.g., "hello.py."</li>
        <li><strong>Start Coding:</strong> Write your Python code in the editor and use the integrated terminal to run the Python file (right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal" or use the terminal shortcut Ctrl+`).</li>
    </ol>
