    <h1>Writing Comments to Document Code in Python</h1>

    <h2>Comments in Python:</h2>
    <p>
        Comments are essential in programming to provide explanations and context about the code. In Python, you can add comments to your code using the <code>#</code> symbol. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are meant to help developers understand the code's purpose and functionality.
    </p>
    <pre class="exercises">
        <code>
            # This is a single-line comment in Python

            # Comments can be used to describe code or provide context
            x = 5  # Assigning a value to the variable 'x'

            # Comments can also be used to disable or "comment out" code
            # print("This line is commented out and won't be executed.")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Multi-Line Comments:</h2>
    <p>
        For multi-line comments, you can use triple quotes (<code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>) to enclose the comment block. While single-line comments are useful for short explanations, multi-line comments are beneficial when you need to provide more extensive documentation or temporarily disable multiple lines of code.
    </p>
    <pre class="exercises">
        <code>
            '''
            This is a multi-line comment in Python.
            It can span multiple lines and is enclosed by triple quotes.
            It is useful for longer explanations or documenting functions and classes.
            '''

            def add(a, b):
                """
                This function takes two arguments and returns their sum.
                Use this function to add two numbers together.
                """
                return a + b
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Best Practices:</h2>
    <p>
        Writing clear and concise comments is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Here are some best practices for writing comments:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.</li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary comments that merely repeat the code's functionality.</li>
        <li>Update comments when modifying code to keep them accurate and relevant.</li>
        <li>Use meaningful variable and function names to reduce the need for excessive comments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        By incorporating comments in your code, you make it easier for yourself and other developers to understand and work with the codebase effectively.
