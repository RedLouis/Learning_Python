    <h1>Introduction to Variables and their Purpose</h1>

    <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
    <p>
        In programming, a variable is a container for storing data. It acts as a named placeholder in memory to hold a value. The value stored in a variable can change during the execution of a program.
    </p>

    <h2>Declaring Variables in Python</h2>
    <p>
        In Python, you can declare a variable by assigning a value to it using the equal sign (<code>=</code>).
    </p>
    <pre class="exercises">
        <code>
            # Variable declaration
            age = 25
            name = "John Doe"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Variable Naming Rules</h2>
    <p>
        When naming variables, keep the following rules in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).</li>
        <li>Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, not with a digit.</li>
        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning "age" and "Age" are considered different variables.</li>
        <li>Avoid using Python reserved words like "if," "else," "while," etc., as variable names.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose of Variables</h2>
    <p>
        Variables play a crucial role in programming and serve various purposes, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storing Data:</strong> Variables hold data that the program uses during execution. For example, storing user input, numerical values, and strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Variables allow you to perform operations and manipulate data easily. You can update, modify, or combine variables to achieve specific tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Variables control the flow of a program. They help in making decisions (using conditional statements) and looping (using loops) based on certain conditions and values.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> By storing data in variables, you can reuse that data multiple times throughout the program, reducing redundancy and making the code more maintainable.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="exercises">
        <code>
            # Variable assignment
            x = 10
            y = "Hello"

            # Variable reassignment
            x = x + 5
            y = y + " World"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Understanding Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        In Python, variables can hold various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type explicitly. The interpreter infers it based on the assigned value.
    </p>
    <pre class="exercises">
        <code>
            # Variables with different data types
            age = 25                  # Integer
            pi = 3.14159              # Floating-point number
            name = "John Doe"         # String
            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]   # List
            person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}      # Dictionary
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Understanding variables is fundamental to programming as they act as containers for data and facilitate the manipulation and control of information within a program.
