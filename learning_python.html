    <h1>Learning Plan: Learn Python with No Knowledge of Coding</h1>

    <h2>Phase 1: Understanding the Basics</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Introduction to Programming:
            <ul>
                <li>Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of programming, such as variables, data types, control structures (if, loops), functions, etc. There are various online resources and tutorials available for this purpose.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Python Installation:
            <ul>
                <li>Install Python on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Python Interactive Shell:
            <ul>
                <li>Start experimenting with Python by using the interactive shell (REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop). This allows you to execute Python code one line at a time and see immediate results.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Simple Python Programs:
            <ul>
                <li>Write your first simple Python programs to practice using variables, arithmetic operations, and basic input/output (print statements, input function).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Types and Variables:
            <ul>
                <li>Learn about different data types in Python: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. Understand how to declare and manipulate variables.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Phase 2: Core Concepts</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to create and use functions in Python. Functions allow you to break down your code into reusable blocks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lists and Loops:
            <ul>
                <li>Explore lists and how to use loops to iterate through them, perform operations, and modify elements.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>String Manipulation:
            <ul>
                <li>Study string manipulation techniques, including slicing, concatenation, formatting, and various built-in string methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Control Flow:
            <ul>
                <li>Dive deeper into control structures like if-else statements, loops (for and while), and logical operators.</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ol>

     <h2>Phase 3: Advanced Concepts</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>File Handling:
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to read from and write to files using Python. This is essential for handling data and interacting with external resources.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exception Handling:
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how to handle errors and exceptions in Python to write robust and reliable code.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dictionaries and Sets:
            <ul>
                <li>Explore dictionaries (key-value pairs) and sets (unordered collections with unique elements) to expand your data manipulation capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce yourself to the principles of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.</li>
