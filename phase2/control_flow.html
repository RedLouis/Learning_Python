    <h2>Advanced Exercises: Control Flow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Palindrome Checker:</strong>
            <p>
                Write a Python program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
            </p>
            <pre class="exercises">
                Input: "radar"
                Output: It is a palindrome.

                Input: "python"
                Output: It is not a palindrome.
            </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Prime Number Checker:</strong>
            <p>
                Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
            </p>
            <pre class="exercises">
                Input: 7
                Output: It is a prime number.

                Input: 12
                Output: It is not a prime number.
            </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Pattern Printing:</strong>
            <p>
                Write a Python program to print the following pattern using loops:
            </p>
            <pre class="exercises">
                Output:
                *
                **
                ***
                ****
                *****
            </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Fibonacci Sequence:</strong>
            <p>
                Write a Python program to generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
            </p>
            <pre class="exercises">
                Input: n = 8
                Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
            </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Leap Year Checker:</strong>
            <p>
                Write a Python program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
            </p>
            <pre class="exercises">
                Input: 2020
                Output: It is a leap year.

                Input: 1900
                Output: It is not a leap year.

                Input: 2000
                Output: It is a leap year.
            </pre>
